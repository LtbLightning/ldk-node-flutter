  /// This allows maximum compatibility: older wallets can always pay using the provided on-chain
  /// address, while newer wallets will typically opt to use the provided BOLT11 invoice or BOLT12 offer.

  /// # Parameters
  /// - `amount_sats`: The amount to be received, specified in satoshis.
  /// - `description`: A description or note associated with the payment.
  ///   This message is visible to the payer and can provide context or details about the payment.
  /// - `expiry_sec`: The expiration time for the payment, specified in seconds.
  ///
  /// Returns a payable URI that can be used to request and receive a payment of the amount
