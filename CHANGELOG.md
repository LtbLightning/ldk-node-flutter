## [0.1.1]
Support `Dart 3` and `Flutter 3.10`

### Fixed
 -  `setEntropyBip39Mnemonic` issue resolved
## [0.1.0]

This is the first release of `ldk_node`. It features support for sourcing chain data via an `Esplora` server, filesystem persistence, gossip sourcing via the `Lightning` peer-to-peer network, and configurble entropy sources for the integrated LDK & BDK-based wallets.

### Functionality Added

`build`- Builds an `Node` instance according to the options previously configured.

`fromConfig`- Creates a new `Builder` instance from an Config.

`setEntropyBip39Mnemonic`- Configures the `Node` instance to source its wallet entropy from a BIP 39 mnemonic.

`setEntropySeedBytes`- Configures the `Node` instance to source its wallet entropy from the given seed bytes.

`setEntropySeedPath`- Configures the `Node` instance to source its wallet entropy from a seed file on disk.

`setEsploraServerUrl`- Sets the `Esplora` server URL. Default: https://blockstream.info/api

`setListeningAddress`- Sets the IP address and TCP port on which Node will listen for incoming network connections. Default: 0.0.0.0:9735

`setNetwork`- Sets the `Bitcoin` network used.

`setStorageDirPath`- Sets the used storage directory path.

`closeChannel`- Close a previously opened channel.

`connect`- Connect to a node on the peer-to-peer network. If permanently is set to true, weâ€™ll remember the peer and reconnect to it on restart

`connectOpenChannel`- Connect to a node and open a new channel. Disconnects and re-connects are handled automatically

`disconnect`- Disconnects the peer with the given `node id`.

`eventHandled`- Confirm the last retrieved event handled.

`listChannels`- Retrieve a list of known channels.

`listPaymentsWithFilter`- Retrieves all payments that match the given predicate.

`listeningAddress`- Returns our own listening address.

`newFundingAddress`- Retrieve a new on-chain/funding address.

`nextEvent`- Blocks until the next event is available.

`nodeId`- Returns our own `node id`.

`onchainBalance`- Retrieve the current on-chain balance.

`payment`- Retrieve the details of a specific payment with the given hash.

`receivePayment`- Returns a payable invoice that can be used to request and receive a payment of the amount given.

`receiveVariableAmountPayment`- Returns a payable invoice that can be used to request and receive a payment for which the amount is to be determined by the user,also known as a `zero-amount` invoice.

`removePayment`- Remove the payment with the given hash from the store.

`sendAllToOnchainAddress`- Send an on-chain payment to the given address, draining all the available funds.

`sendPayment`- Send a payement given an invoice.

`sendPaymentUsingAmount`- Send a payment given an invoice and an amount in millisatoshi.

`sendSpontaneousPayment`- Send a spontaneous, aka. `keysend`, payment.

`sendToOnchainAddress`- Send an on-chain payment to the given address.

`start`- Starts the necessary background tasks, such as handling events coming from user input, `LDK/BDK`, and the peer-to-peer network.

`stop`- Disconnects all peers, stops all running background tasks, and shuts down Node.

`syncWallets`- Sync the `LDK & BDK` wallets with the current chain state.
